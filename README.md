# ðŸ§  Autism Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on their responses to a screening questionnaire and demographic data.

The goal is to assist early screening by building a reliable model that can classify individuals as ASD-positive or not, using real-world questionnaire data.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

- Loads and preprocesses the dataset (label encoding, handling imbalance with SMOTE)
- Trains classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Saves the best-performing model for later use with `pickle`

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Features

The dataset includes:
- Answers to 10 screening questions (A1_Score to A10_Score)
- Age, gender, ethnicity, jaundice history, and app usage
- Family history of autism, screening result, and relation to the respondent
- Target: `Class/ASD` indicating if the person likely has ASD (YES/NO)
